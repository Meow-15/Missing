            Dear Wifey ❤️,
        </div>
        <div id="content">
            I hope you are well there 😊. My love for you has increased by a thousand folds after meeting you 💖. After every meeting, I get to know more about you, and with that, my love for you grows even more 💑. On my way home, the song 'Newyork Nagaram' hit me really hard 🎶. Thank you soooooo much, di kutty chathan, for giving me this ring 💍. I really love it and I am gonna treasure it for my life. During these holidays, I missed you soooo much, di. 😢 I wish I was with you during these days. Every second that passed by felt like eternity ⏳. Sometimes I planned to call Raskha and ask her to call you just to hear your voice, but later I dropped that plan because it would disturb her. I love you sooooo much, baby, chello, ammu, kutty chathan, pondati, poona kutty, my world, my life, my everything💞............ I wish these holidays end sooner so that I can speak to you 🗓️. I wish we are born as magnets in our next lifetime so that no one can separate us 🔗. Love you di dayamahima 💕. I am waiting for the day when I can call your Dr. Kutty Chathan Calyx.
